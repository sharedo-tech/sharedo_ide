# Sample IDE Widget - Create instruction file upload widget

## Overview
Simple IDE widget that captures some (very) basic data concerning a new instruction (it's reference and title), and allows user to choose one or more files to upload to the instruction as supporting documentation (evidence/statements/other). The user can choose files directly or drag/drop upload them. Leverages the work item create API and the related documents API to upload the files.
